"""Synchronized parallel pipeline that holds output until all branches finish.

A SyncParallelPipeline fans each inbound frame out to multiple parallel pipelines
and waits for every pipeline to finish processing before releasing any of the
resulting output frames. This ensures that all frames produced in response to a
single input frame are emitted together.

System frames (except EndFrame) are exempt from this synchronization — they pass
straight through without waiting, since they are expected to race ahead of
regular data frames. An EndFrame is pushed once, after every branch's output.

    An ``EndFrame`` gets no ``SyncFrame``, since nothing follows it through a
